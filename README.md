# WeatherSite

Created a one-page HTML site which takes the location using the DOM geolocation.

* Takes this and uses this to fetch the location using googlemaps
* a fetch request is used to ipgeolocation and the city is returned
* using the date I have coded a system to return a photo from unsplash.com dependant on the time of the year.
